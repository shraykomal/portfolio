## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview: Customer Churn Prediction App

### ðŸ§© Business Context

In the subscription-based telecom industry, **retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones**. Identifying which customers are likely to churn allows companies to proactively offer incentives, improve service, or address dissatisfaction before they leave.

This project simulates a real-world business case where a telecom provider aims to:
- Predict customer churn using historical data
- Visualize and interact with predictions via a lightweight web app
- Empower marketing and support teams to act on churn insights

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Build a **machine learning model** to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on demographic, service usage, and account information.  
Deploy the model using **Streamlit** to provide an intuitive web interface for non-technical users.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Business Outcomes

- Enables **proactive retention strategies** (e.g., loyalty offers for high-risk users)
- Helps **segment customers** based on churn probability and service behavior
- Improves visibility for business teams through a clean **interactive dashboard**
- Demonstrates how machine learning supports **customer lifetime value (CLV)** optimization
