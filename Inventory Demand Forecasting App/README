# 🏗️ Inventory Demand Forecasting App

## 🧩 Business Context

Construction and manufacturing companies often struggle with **stockouts** or **overstocking** of materials like bricks, tiles, or drywall. This leads to **project delays, wasted budget, and poor vendor coordination**. Forecasting future demand helps procurement and supply chain teams **order the right materials at the right time**, improving project efficiency and cost control.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a **machine learning or statistical forecasting model** to predict the next **30–90 days** of demand for construction materials (e.g., bricks, tiles, cabinets) based on historical usage data.  
Deploy the model as an **interactive dashboard or app** that lets users:

- ✅ Select a material (e.g., "Red Brick Type A")  
- 📈 View historical usage  
- 🔮 See future predictions  
- 📁 Download the forecast as a CSV file
